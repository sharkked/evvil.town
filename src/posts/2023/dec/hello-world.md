## what up
it's about time i try to make a website for real, yk? the formatting and shit is gonna change over time, but for now i'm kinda happy with how it's started.

plans are to get a gallery going (that's what the '[art](/art)' tab is for hehe), put more social links in here and some such. it'll be real nice to have all this shit in one spot.

it's gonna be may
